HISTORY 
 
To most Americans in the late 1800, Dumaguete was a name their tongue was still to master. It was 
unfamiliar to them. Even the Philippines, which at that time was still recovering from the onslaught of the 
Spanish-American War, was not on the immediate list for a Presbyterian mission. It took the vision and 
commitment of a man to turn this around. 
 
The late Dr. Arthur Carson, third Silliman president, wrote in his book how a man’s strong resolve to help 
shape Philippine education paved the way for the establishment of Silliman University. This man was Dr. 
Horace B. Silliman, a retired businessman of the town of Cohoes in New York State.  
 
In 1899, Dr. Silliman appeared at the office of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions with the 
conviction that the Filipino people would need a new kind of education. He contributed the initial sum of 
$10,000 toward the founding of an industrial school. Legend has it that the Board Secretary was surprised 
and explained that the Board had only begun to consider a mission in the Philippine islands. At that time, 
news was fresh on the naval victory of Admiral Dewey over the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. The Board 
Secretary thought it would be too early for a school. 
 
But the visitor persisted. Something had caught his imagination about these islands, and the people whom 
he had never seen and whom he would never meet. 
 
Dr. Silliman had long been an active supporter of schools and colleges. Among such institutions was 
Hampton Institute of Virginia. His proposal to the Presbyterian Board was for an industrial school in the 
Philippines on the Hampton model. 
 
The mission in the Philippines started with Dr. David Sutherland Hibbard and wife, Laura, who were 
commissioned to head it. Three areas were considered: Cebu, Zamboanga and Iloilo. While in Cebu, 
someone suggested for him to make a side trip to Dumaguete. Sailing from Cebu on a Saturday night, he 
came out early on deck the next morning and saw “the unsurpassed drama of a Dumaguete morning from 
the sea.” 
 
It was told that the friendly attitude of the people and the caliber of the local officials attracted him to 
Dumaguete, a “place of health and beauty.” 
 
On August 28, 1901, Silliman Institute was established. As Dr. Hibbard described the modest beginning 
of Silliman half a century later, “There were fifteen boys that first morning. The equipment consisted of 
four desks about ten feet long, two tables and two chairs, a few McGuffey’s Readers, a few geographies, 
arithmetic and ninth-grade grammars. I was President; Mrs. Hibbard was the faculty.” 
 
Enrollment in the university grew gradually to include students from Asian countries. The year 1912 
marked the admission into the university of the first female student, Pura Blanco. Silliman was granted 
university status in 1938. 
 
Developments on campus were interrupted by two significant events in Philippine history: World War II 
and martial law. Silliman braved these historic events and left dents on the pages of Philippine history. 
 
At the height of the war, Silliman faculty members and students evacuated to four localities in Negros 
Oriental, and continued rendering professional services whenever there was an opportunity. This led to 
the establishment of the ‘jungle university’ in the mountain of Malabo -- the first community school in the 
Philippines. 
 
In 1972, when martial law was declared, Silliman was one of the first two universities closed. It was also 
one of the last universities allowed to resume operations after the closure. Martial Law, despite its threat 
    
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    3 
to life and democracy, did not stop students from gathering and keeping their patriotism aflame. At the 
basement of the Silliman University Church, in a room named the Catacombs, the ‘secret’ campus 
rendezvous of students continued. 
 
The rich contribution of Silliman to Philippine history and landscape earned it the distinction of being 
declared National Landmark by the National Historical Institute on June 19, 2002. 
 
Growth of Silliman in the early period was greatly attributable to the support of the local community. 
Local families shared in the vision of Dr. Silliman and believed in the educational pursuits of Dr. and 
Mrs. Hibbard, and accordingly offered their properties through sale and donation to expand the campus. 
Later developments were characterized by more infrastructure development and initiation of student 
activities, ranging from journalism, public speaking, performing arts, to athletics. 
 
Silliman continues to be nurtured under administrations headed by presidents of character and tested 
credentials. The incumbent President, its twelfth, is Dr. Ben S. Malayang III, an expert in environmental 
policy and governance. A Silliman alumnus, he holds two Master of Arts degrees from the Ohio 
University: one in International Affairs Southeast Asia Studies; Major in Economics (Minor in Political 
Science), and another in Philosophy. He earned the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Wildland Resource 
Science from the University of California at Berkeley.    
 
Three American, and eight Filipino, have previously served as elected Silliman presidents: Dr. David 
Hibbard (1901-1930), Dr. Roy Brown (1932-1936), Dr. Arthur Carson (1939-1953); Dr. Leopoldo Ruiz 
(1953-1961); Dr. Cicero Calderon (1962-1971); Dr. Quintin Doromal (1973-1982); Justice Venancio 
Aldecoa (1983-1986); Dr. Pedro Flores (1987-1989); Dr. Angel Alcala (1991-1992); Dr. Mervyn Misajon 
(1994-1996); and Dr. Agustin Pulido (1996-2006).

UNIVERSITY MANUAL    35 
 
Operative Principles 
 
Communication and participation are two key principles that are involved in the operationalization of 
an LMC. Communication lies at the very core of employee-employer relations and therefore plays a 
very important role in the relationship. Communication enables both parties to offer feedback and 
information relative to existing conditions and the various work-related policies. It provides for free 
flow of ideas between labor and management on matters that affect both of them. 
 
 
LMC in Silliman University: Scope and Structure 
 
Guided by the foregoing principles, the establishment of Labor-Management Committee in Silliman 
will make the University more robust, and more responsive in addressing employee and management-
related concerns.  
 
It bears pointing that the establishment of an LMC is not intended to supplant or replace the unions. 
Nor does it delve into matters already covered by their respective collective bargaining agreements. 
Thus, in Silliman University, the unions (SUFA and SUSA) will continue to exist and will remain to 
be contractually bound to the collective bargaining agreement they signed with the Administration.  
 
The LMC in the University will be “tripartite” in nature with the position of presiding officer rotated 
among its members. In other words, the LMC will be composed of representatives from the 
Administration, the SUFA and the SUSA with each of the three sectors having three representatives 
each, or a total of nine. One of the members of both SUFA and SUSA must be the president of the 
union. On the part of the Administration, the University President will sit as one of the representatives 
for Administration.  
 
Furthermore, various technical working groups or TWGs will be under the LMC. The TWGs will 
focus on specific areas of concern. Each TWG will have three members coming from the three sectors 
and will have a chairperson to be rotated amongst themselves. Each TWG shall report to the LMC. 
Their findings are recommendatory in nature, and are subject to discussion and approval by the LMC. 
Recommendations to be made by the TWGs shall be consensus-based, not a quorum or majority-
based. The same goes with the LMC proper. Insofar as the LMC is concerned, the latter may decide 
on matters that fall within existing University or BOT-approved policies. However, if its action does 
not fall within any existing policy approved by the BOT, its action will require the approval of the 
BOT before it can be implemented.  
 
 
Its structure may be illustrated as follows: 
 
To reiterate, the LMC will only 
deal on matters not covered by 
collective bargaining agreements. 
 
In addition, institutional 
courtesies will have to be 
respected. In other words, matters 
that properly fall within the 
domain of each of the unions will 
not be touched by the LMC. These 
matters may be spelled out in 
more detail as discussions 
regarding the LMC progresses.

Section 6 - TUTORIAL POLICY 
 
Definition  
 
 
 
Tutorial class is one which is:  
a. An off-semester offering 
b. Requested by the students through a formal letter to the Dean/Director 
c. The number of students in the class is less than the break-even size as determined herein 
d. One which is certified by the Dean/Director as necessary for graduation for those requesting for it 
 
 
If condition above is not satisfied, then the class may be considered a regular class.  
 
 
A course which is a regular semester offering for the semester is considered a regular load regardless 
of class size.  
 
 
As a matter of policy, tutorial class is discouraged.  
 
  
44   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
 
Faculty Compensation  
 
a. Faculty compensation for tutorial class should not be more than the equivalent pay for the 
corresponding load.  
b. Compensation should be integrated in the regular pay of the faculty.  
c. Compensation for faculty should be computed in the manner described herein.  
 
Computation  
 
a. Break-even class size. The break-even class size is determined by the corresponding equivalent 
load of the faculty, the number of units for the tutorial class and the tuition rate for the course.  
 
 
 
 
S – equivalent salary for the load per semester 
 
 
 
R – tuition rate  
 
 
 
U – number of units  
 
 
 
I – income  
 
 
 
E – expenses  
 
 
 
N – number of students at break-even 
 
 
 
n – number of students enrolled in the class 
 
 
 
A – amount due for the class  
 
 
 
a – amount due per student enrolled in the class 
 
 
 
s – amount due the faculty  
 
 
 
 
 
I = E 
 
I = URN 
 
 
 
 
 
 
E = S + .31  
 
 
 
 
 
 
∴S =.7URN 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
N =  S 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      .7UR 
 
 
 
For a 3-unit subject: 
N =  S 
2.1 R 
 
 
 
For a 5-unit subject:  
N = S 
 
 
 
 
 
      3.5 R 
 
b. Student assessment. As per Deans Conference Action 2000-01:22, students enrolled in the tutorial 
class should be assessed the amount equivalent to one student less than the break-even class.  
 
The computation for the amount for each student in the tutorial should be:  
 
A = UR (N-1)   
a = A – UR (N-1)  
 
 
 
      n            n 
 
c. Faculty computation. Under the existing University policy, faculty compensation is computed as 
70% of the income derived from the class. Hence:  
 
 
S =   .7 UR (N-1)  
 
 
 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    45 
 
Charges  
 
Charges for students in the tutorial class should be integrated in the student account. To facilitate the 
process, the faculty concern should submit to the Dean’s/Director’s office the names of the students 
in the class with their corresponding signatures not later than one week after the commencement of 
the class. The document should also be signed by the faculty concerned.  
 
The Dean/Director should submit the list – a copy of which is retained by the office – to the VPAA

In computing for the quality point average (QPA) for graduation and honors, the subjects are weighed 
according to the respective number of units assigned to a course.  
 
A grade of “Inc” (Incomplete) indicates that the student has not completed all the assigned work for the 
course.  An “Inc” must be completed within the following term in the semester in which the course was 
taken; otherwise the grade automatically becomes “NC” for “No Credit,” or “NG” for “No Grade”.   An 
“NC” or “NG” grade is permanent and cannot be subsequently changed due to the lapse of the prescribed 
period of completing the requirements. 
 
The letter “W” shows that the student has dropped a course with the written permission of his/her 
Dean/Director/Principal.  If a student drops a course without the written permission of his/her 
Dean/Director/Principal, the grade for the course automatically becomes “F”.  “WF” is recorded when a 
student officially withdraws from the course but is failing at the time the withdrawal was made. 
 
For non-credit subjects the two letters, S and U, are used; S to denote the satisfactory completion of the 
course, and U for unsatisfactory work. 
 
In order to graduate, a minimum cumulative quality point average (cQPA) is required at the end of the term 
in which the student completes his/her course in the following:  Baccalaureate programs, 2.0; Law, 2.3; 
Medical School, 2.5; Master’s program, 3.0; and Doctorate programs, 3.5. 
 
As additional requirement for graduation and progression in the degree program, all designated 
undergraduate professional courses or major subjects must have the minimum QPA set by the college and 
approved by the Academic Council. 
 
All courses under the Master’s and Doctorate programs must have a minimum grade of 3.0 and 3.5, 
respectively. 
 
Section 2 - PREPARATION OF GRADES 
 
Preparation of grades refers to the construction of examination papers, test administration, correcting of 
test papers, computation of the grades, preparation of grading sheets, including the preparation of F-137 
for Elementary and F-138 for High School. 
 
All teachers should prepare the grades and submit them on time to the Office of the Dean and the 
Registrar and Admissions Office. 
 
Section 3 - SUBMISSION OF GRADES  
 
1. Grades must be reported to the department chair or, if there is no department chair, directly to the 
dean or director of the college or school within five (5) working days from the administration of 
the mid-term and final examinations. The grades are encoded in the database to give time for the 
student to view, and question on, entries. No petition for change of grade will be entertained three 
(3) weeks after submission. 
2. The Registrar will be responsible for the official release of final grades to students or to their 
parents or guardians. 
3. Mid-term and final grades of non-graduating students must be in the hands of the Office of the 
Registrar not later than ten (10) days from the examination dates.   
  
48   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
4. By reason of the type and nature of examination given in these schools, the Graduate School and 
Divinity School are allowed twenty (20) days, and the College of Law thirty (30) days, from the 
date the examination is given. 
5. Appropriate sanctions for violating these rules shall be imposed by the Academic Council. All 
Deans and Directors are enjoined to enforce these rules strictly. 
 
Section 4 - GUIDELINES ON THE CHANGE OF GRADE AND INCOMPLETE GRADES  
 
1. The allowable period to change the grade is within three weeks from the date of the final 
submission of grades to the department concerned, to give time for the student to question entries 
of teacher or for committee to deliberate.  
2. When request for change of grade is done after grades are submitted to the Registrar, the teacher 
files a sworn statement or affidavit in quadruplicate to the Dean/Director. The affidavit must be 
reviewed and notarized by the University General Counsel (for free) of the University as 
recommended by the Executive Committee of the Office of the Presidents during its meeting on 
June 30, 2014.  
3. Completion of the requirements by the student of INC (incomplete) mark must be within the 
semester following that in which the course was taken. Otherwise, the grade automatically 
becomes “NG”. An automatic “NC” or “NG” grade is permanent and cannot be subsequently 
changed due to the lapse of the prescribed period of completing the requirements.  
4. It should be emphasized that filing of completion grade form to the Dean/Director, then to the 
Registrar, must be done by the teacher, and not by the student himself or herself, or any other 
person. Any alteration of entries in the completion grade form must be initiated by the teacher.  
5. If in any case that the teacher failed immediately to report the completion grade, he/she petitions 
to the Dean/Director, then submits to the Registrar, for the correction to be done within one year 
that the course was taken, with four copies of the affidavit required in No. 5 of the Policy on 
Change of Grades. 
6. As a general rule, no corrections to the grades given should be allowed after the Registrar has 
forwarded the supplementary XIX report to the commission on Higher Education in the Regional 
Office. (MORPHE, Art. XII, Section 107.)  
 
 
 
VI. RULES ON INTEGRITYAND PLAGIARISM 
 
1. As members of the academe, the faculty and academic staff must adhere strictly to a high standard of 
intellectual integrity. This should be reflected not only in one’s relationship with one’s colleagues, but 
especially in one’s written workbooks, syllabi, dissertation, papers and other manuscripts. 
2. Academic personnel, teaching or non-teaching, should be as original as possible in their written work.  
Where material is taken from the work of other authors or writers, it should be properly 
acknowledged.  Failure to do so shall be deemed an act of intellectual dishonesty. 
3. Plagiarism is the highest form of intellectual dishonesty.  As defined by authorities – 
 
a) Plagiarism is the act of appropriating the literary composition of another, or parts or passages of 
his/her writings, or the ideas or language of the same, and passing them off as the product of one’s 
own mind (Black’s Law Dictionary, 1891 ed.) 
 
b) Plagiarism is the adoption of the literary composition or artistic production of another persona and 
the publication thereof as an original composition or production.  (Ballentine’s Law Dictionary, 1930 
ed.) 
4.  Those guilty of plagiarism or intellectual dishonesty, as determined by a committee of peers, shall be 
subject to either suspension or dismissal, depending on the gravity of the offense.

VIII. University Policy on Ethical Conduct in Research and Standard Operating Procedures 
 
The Philippine Health Research Ethics Board (PHREB) and the Commission on Higher Education 
(CHED) advice that Philippine Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) engaged in biomedical and 
behavioral research establish an institutional ethics review committee, which shall provide independent, 
competent, and timely review of the ethics of proposed studies.   
 
The PHREB encourages HEIs to use as references the WHO Operational Guidelines for Ethics 
Committees that Review Biomedical Research (2000), and the 2011 National Ethical Guidelines for 
Health Research. However, PHREB requires that HEIs should develop their respective manual of 
standard operating procedures. 
 
Hence, the ADHOC Committee on Research Ethics, proposes the adoption of the University Policy on 
Ethical Conduct in Research and Standard operating procedures  
 
 
Section 1: Guiding Principles 
 
A. Five Basic Guiding Principles 
As a research university, Silliman University commits itself to the production and dissemination of new 
knowledge for total human development and  the well-being of society and environment. As community 
of learners, scholars and artists, we pursue this calling within the framework of Christian ideals revealed 
in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, who is the Via, Veritas, Vita. As a Protestant institution, the 
University strives to integrate the Christian biblical values of life, justice and truth in the search for new 
knowledge. We uphold the dignity, protect the rights, guarantee the safety, and preserve the well-being of 
all involved in or affected by the conduct of research. 
  
54   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
The conduct of research in the University is governed by a system of moral principles that aims to 
maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct in every aspect of research including applications, 
proposals, data-gathering, reports and publications.  These   ethical standards are anchored on the 
following basic moral principles: 
 
Truth 
Silliman University affirms that all truths come from God. The bible says “the Truth shall set you free.” 
(John 8,32) The conduct of research at the University is founded on a commitment to honesty and 
transparency. The University, its research organizations and researchers ensure that all their presentations 
and interpretations of experimental data and other factual information are accurate, free from deceit and 
fraud, and give due recognition to works of others;  
 
Respect for Persons (and Community) 
Human beings have inherent rights and dignity regardless of age, race, religion, sex and gender.  Christian 
teaching affirms that human beings are created in the image and likeness of God (Gen.1.26-27). 
Regardless of religions and ideologies, we believe that every human being is free with the capacity to 
decide and make choices.  The dignity, rights, safety and well-being of participants must be the primary 
consideration in any research study. Researchers shall always respect human participants including the 
community by minimizing risk of harm to participants and researchers. Ensure that voluntary informed 
consent is obtained from all human participants or special safeguards where this is not possible. 
Information supplied by research participants shall be treated with utmost confidentiality. Coercion, 
undue inducement, manipulation and humiliation of human participants shall be avoided in the conduct of 
research by anyone in the University.   
 
Integrity & Professionalism  
Research integrity may be defined as adherence to the ethical principles and professional standards 
essential to the responsible conduct of research. Integrity in research means honesty and responsibility in 
scholarship. It is a faithful compliance with ethical and legal obligations as required by statutory and 
regulatory authorities, including seeking ethical review and approval for research as deemed appropriate. 
Researchers in particular disciplines should comply with any research ethics guidelines set by their 
professional associations. 
 
Stewardship of the Environment 
 
The Bible teaches that human beings are to “subdue and have dominion” over creation (Genesis 1:22). 
We are to use and develop nature. The Bible also says that human beings are to till (nurture) the 
environment and keep [protect] it (Genesis 2:26) or be the stewards of the environment. Stewardship is 
defined as “the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one's care."1   The 
principle of stewardship of the environment in the conduct of research entails awareness and practices

 Merriam-Webster's Online Collegiate Dictionary, 2001 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    55 
that protect, conserve, develop and sustain natural resources and our environment for future generations. 
Precautionary protocols are strictly followed in the conduct of research that affect the environment, other 
species and community.   
Solidarity 
In  the  pursuit  of  new  knowledge,  the University recognizes the value of working and acting 
collaboratively in the spirit of inclusiveness and solidarity. To foster cooperation among researchers, the 
University encourages the  open exchange of ideas, methods, data, and analysis. To build trust and 
community the University honors all obligations and agreements. 
 
Section II: Establishment of an Ethics Review Committee  
 
Objective

well as approval to ensure that any research undertaken within, or on behalf of, the university, meets the 
highest ethical standards.    
 
A. Responsibilities of Research Ethics Committee. 
All research involving human subjects and animals should undergo ethics review before it starts, in 
accordance with the principle that investigators should not be the sole judge in determining whether or not 
their research raises significant ethics issues.

Honorarium – this section needs further deliberation with the Administration 
 
For student researches – no fees 
 
For researches with funding – with fees  
 
Adverse decisions 
Although it is unlikely for a project to be found unacceptable in its entirety, it is common for projects to 
be modified following committee recommendations. In case of an adverse decision on a proposal, 
reason/s for such a decision should be given to the applicant in writing. An applicant should be made 
aware that he is entitled to make written or oral representations to the committee to have an adverse 
decision reviewed.  
When there are dissenting opinions among the sub-committee members, any one of the members shall ask 
the UREC to invite an expert to help the full-committee  resolve the issue. 
Monitoring 
Even though it is impracticable for a Committee to monitor in detail the ongoing investigations, follow-up 
is needed so as to be abreast with the developments on approved investigations. Information on the 
progress of a project, whether completed, abandoned (with justifications) or still in progress in its original 
form, and on any adverse events affecting the project should be sought annually. The concerned 
researcher should submit regular progress reports to the committee. 
 
 
  
58   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
Sanctions 
Ethics review committees have no power to effect sanctions. An investigator who bypasses or ignores the 
recommendations of the committee is liable to professional disciplinary proceedings by the University. 
UREC can recommend to the appropriate disciplinary committee 
Where the Committee is dissatisfied with the conduct of an investigation, it shall withdraw its prior 
approval of the project informing the investigator of the fact in writing; this decision shall also be 
conveyed to the Research Council and/or Deans Conference. The research, if still on-going, should 
immediately cease and the researcher shall not thereafter claim that said research has UREC approval. 
Report 
The UREC will send an annual report to Deans Conference, Academic Council and the Research 
Development Council. This will include the list of Committee members, number of meetings, other 
relevant matters, and a list of approved project titles within the period.   
Details of the committee’s deliberations shall remain confidential. 
Administrative Support 
The required administrative and secretarial assistance should be made available by the Office of the 
VPAA. 
Legal Responsibilities 
 
The public will reasonably expect that research involving human participants and animal subjects be 
conducted in accordance with existing laws. The University upholds two fiduciary duties in the conduct 
of research (although not exclusively); 
Confidentiality 
Access to research data may be limited by confidentiality agreement, normally for the purposes of 
protecting: human participants who are the subject of the research; intellectual property that may be 
covered by a commercial or contractual arrangement; confidential source materials;. 
Confidential data and records will be made available for discussion with other researchers subject to 
confidentiality provisions. 
The Director of Research, the researcher(s) and the Dean of the School shall be responsible in ensuring 
that arrangements are made to protect the security of any confidential research data, including data stored 
in computer systems. 
Conflict of interest 
Researchers must disclose to the Dean of School and the Director of Research any affiliation with or 
financial involvement in any organization or entity with a direct interest in the subject matter or materials 
of the researcher. The researcher must identify all received/enjoyed direct benefits such as sponsorship of 
the research; indirect benefits which may include provision of materials or facilities; and/or support 
through provision of travel or accommodation expenses to attend conferences, or similar benefits. 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    59

probationary period for non-academic personnel as provided for by the Labor Code (Article 281) applies 
only if the employee is engaged full-time (i.e. working 8 hours a day). 
 
The University requires an initial probationary period for all new employees. This probationary period 
allows time for adjustment on the job and an opportunity to determine whether it will be in the best 
interests of the employee and the employer for the employment relationship to continue. During the 
probationary period, the supervisor has an opportunity to determine if the employee has skills and abilities 
necessary to perform the duties required in the position, and the new employee may assess whether a 
working relationship should continue. In addition, this can be a time to identify training needs and begin 
the training process. 
 
C. Temporary Employment 
 
A temporary appointment is a written contract which specifically states the period covered by the 
employment (start up to termination), the compensation, and other conditions. A temporary appointment 
imposes no obligation on the University to renew employment after the contract period expires. 
 
Note: Temporary teachers on T10 status shall be given T12 status after one year of satisfactory fulltime 
teaching. Temporary teachers on T5 status who have rendered two (2) consecutive semesters of 
satisfactory full time service shall be considered to have had T10 status during that year, unless the said 
teacher is to serve only for one (1) more semester. (refer to the SU-SUFA CBA) 
 
D. Project Employment  
 
A Project employee is an employee assigned to carry out a specific project or undertaking, the duration 
and scope of which are specified at the time the employee is engaged in the project. A project is a job or 
undertaking, which is distinct, separate, and identifiable from the usual or regular undertaking of the 
institution. A project employee is assigned to a project, which begins and ends at determined or 
determinable times. 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    63 
E. Subcontracting (refer to DOLE DO 18-A) 
 
Subcontracting refers to an arrangement whereby a principal agrees to put out or farm out with a 
contractor the performance or completion of a specific job, work or service within a definite or 
predetermined period, regardless of whether such job, work or service is to be performed or completed 
within or outside the premises of the principal. 
 
F. Visiting Scholars’ Program 
 
The content requirements of our curricular offerings and the world of knowledge in general keep on 
changing and accumulating. It is imperative that for Silliman to maintain its position as among the 
country’s top universities,  its corps of faculty is constantly being enriched by a regular inflow and stream 
of some visiting and engaged topnotch academic and professional personalities. 
 
It will be to Silliman’s advantage and a boost to its educational services if a number of highly credentialed 
and experienced professional and professorial personalities were to be regularly associated with its roster 
of permanent and tenured faculty and staff. This is even if for precisely the reason of their high 
credentials, they are unable to commit to a full-time engagement in Silliman. Availing of their presence as 
persons holding certain academic ranks in Silliman, even if only part-time and non-tenured, would be a 
value to Silliman students and to Silliman’s reputation. This is without the associated cost to the 
university on salaries and benefits if it were to hire additional personnel full-time. 
 
 
The Visiting Scholars Program 
 
This Program which the Board first approved in 2006, allows the University to make special non-
tenure and part-time academic appointments of persons to be engaged to do limited teaching,  
research, extension or institutional work in Silliman.    They are to be paid gratuity either from 
externally sourced funds or from budgeted university funds for projects or personnel services.    These 
presently include academicians, clergy, artists and researchers engaged to teach 3 to 6 units (where 
the need occurs) or as regular (short-term) adjunct faculty, visiting researchers,  lecturers and artistic 
performance mentors.     
 
 
Categories 
 
The following categorization of appointments under the Visiting Scholars Program is to be adopted 
effective June 1, 2012: 
 
Adjunct Faculty.     Covers former faculty members of Silliman or active faculty of another 
university properly credentialed to participate in Silliman’s academic life.    They shall be 
accorded the courtesy of being recognized as possessing the academic rank they already have 
before their appointment as adjunct personnel. 
 
Fellows.    Covers persons of very high and considerable professional experience and whose 
reputation as such meets the level expected of a Silliman faculty, and who agrees to be engaged in 
Silliman as a regular or recurring general and integrative lecturer, student adviser, graduate panel 
member,  book writer,  provider of extension services, or as a researcher. 
 
Non-Tenure Faculty.   Covers persons possessing the academic and professional credentials 
sufficient to quality as a faculty of tertiary schools but who agrees to do only limited and 
regularly recurring teaching and other academic functions in Silliman for at least 5 years.   They 
are to be compensated on actual contact time and with benefits limited to what is provided by 
law.   In appreciation of how their credentials will actually also boost the institutional reputation 
and value to Silliman, and to ensure their equal stature and standing as faculty to students and 
  
64   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
others, they shall be accorded appropriate academic ranks (but indicated in records as “non-
tenure”).   The assignment of ranks shall be made consistent with existing standards and 
procedures in the university, as would be applicable to part-time and non-tenured faculty.   Any 
rank assignment shall be indorsed by the Dean,  certified to meet standards by the HRD and 
VPAA, recommended by the Deans Conference, and, up to Assistant Professor, approved by the 
President.    Recommendations for Associate Professors or Professors shall require Board of 
Trustees approval. 
 
Appointments under this category shall be particularly considered for faculty complements in the 
College of Law,  School of Medicine,  College of Engineering and Design,  and Accountancy, 
whose programs can richly benefit from having a list of highly credentialed practitioners in their 
faculty who are too often not available for full-time academic engagement. 
 
G. Adjunct  
 
The title Adjunct Professor may be bestowed upon a person who is not a full-time member of the faculty.   
The granting of the title reflects some mutually beneficial scholarly association between the University 
and the candidate.    The qualifications and terms of appointment will be determined by the academic 
unit(s) in which the position is to be held according to the following terms of reference: 
 
 
The title Adjunct Professor may be granted for any of the following purposes: 
• 
To supervise or co-supervise graduate or undergraduate students. 
• 
To contribute to other scholarly pursuits of the department. 
• 
To facilitate the pursuit of independent research. 
 
 
Procedure  
 
A candidate for the title is nominated by the Chair/Director of the appropriate academic unit 
following normal unit procedures. The nomination is forwarded to the Dean of the appropriate 
academic unit, with concurrent notification thereof to the Vice-President for Academic Affairs.   In 
the case of interdisciplinary interests, the Chair/Directors of the appropriate academic units will 
jointly nominate to the Dean(s) of the academic unit(s) concerned. Each nomination must be 
accompanied by full curriculum vitae of the candidate and an explanation of the purpose of the 
appointment. 
 
Subject to a favorable decision from the office of the VPAA, the Dean of the academic unit 
concerned will invite the candidate to be an Adjunct Professor.   In the event that the candidate is a 
member of an institution,  the approval of the head of that institution must also be obtained prior to 
invitation to the candidate. 
 
An adjunct Professor usually serves the University without remuneration from the University.  
However, if responsible for a formal lecture course the Adjunct Professor will be entitled to the part-
time lecturer salary. 
 
 
Rights and Responsibilities of an Adjunct Professor

He/she may supervise or co-supervise the research work of students proceeding toward either a 
Baccalaureate or graduate degree, subject to all regulations pertaining to the student’s academic 
uni(s) and program. 
• 
He/she may be asked to give a regular seminar or to lecture on a subject pertaining closely to 
his/her field of professional competence. 
• 
He/she should attend those academic unit meetings where his/her presence is requested. 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    65 
• 
His/her research projects undertaken in association with the University shall not be of a type 
which may limit publication of some or all of the results in the form of theses and or papers in 
scholarly journals. 
• 
He/she may provide needed equipment and services for the successful completion of each student 
research project undertaken in his/her establishment with him/her as the co-supervisor. 
 
H. Graduate Students Under Adjunct Professors.    
 
Full-time students under the supervision or co-supervision of Adjunct Professors are subject to the same 
conditions and rules as other graduate students. 
 
I. Fellows 
 
Fellows in Silliman University comprise of exceptional practitioners and personalities in fields of 
Medicine, Law and Accountancy, whose services in the University may include at least one lecture every 
academic year.

division.   The rank shall be enjoyed by the non-tenured faculty during his service to the University.

J. Non-Tenure Faculty 
 
“Professor of the Practice” is a title to describe a non-tenured faculty position at Silliman University to be 
held by a limited number of eminently qualified academic, business, or government leaders who have 
made major impacts on fields and disciplines important to Silliman University’s programs. 
 
The title “Professor of the Practice” is intended to provide such highly regarded individuals with the 
positioning and respect that is customarily extended to faculty members who hold tenure.   This 
designation represents an effective and meaningful way for Silliman University to involve accomplished 
professionals who seek a position within a leading university that meets the professional’s interests and 
capabilities. 
 
Because of the stature of individuals to be offered this position, the category will have only one rank,  
rather than Professor,  Associate Professor, or Assistant Professor of the Practice.   Unlike the currently 
available title of  “Adjunct Professor,”   the expectation is that Professor of the Practice would be paid, 
either on a fulltime or part-time basis as appropriate for the situation. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
66   UNIVERSITY MANUAL

to Silliman University’s teaching and research programs, and who are committed to enhancing 
Silliman University’s programs and reputation.

C. Study Leave (Refer to FADECO policies) 
 
Silliman University recognizes the basic freedom of faculty members to pursue activities that will 
redound to their professional growth and development. Due consideration, however, must be given to the 
institution’s plan for human resource development based on its priorities and available resources. Study 
leaves are normally granted to regular employees. However, exceptions may be granted to promising 
employees recommended by the department chair and dean of the college or by the immediate supervisor 
in the case of staff, and approved by FADECO/STADECO. 
 
The period of a study leave is two years for Masters degree and four years for Doctoral degree.  Requests 
for extension of study leave must be initiated by the grantee. 
 
To achieve integration and coordination in the development plans of various persons and units in the 
University, the procedures outlined below have to be followed: 
 
1. The Dean of an academic unit and, wherever applicable, the Department Chairperson, should take 
steps to ensure proper dissemination of information on (1) scholarship grants available to the faculty, 
(2) FADECO administered scholarships or grants, (3) the type of study leaves available and the 
conditions attached to them, and (4) alternative scholarship schemes. 
2. An applicant for study leave with or without FADECO scholarship grant should confer with the Dean 
and Chairperson of the academic unit to which he/she belongs concerning his/her proposed program 
of study.

3. Applications should be endorsed to the Vice President for Academic Affairs by the Dean. If an 
application for scholarship grant and/or study leave is disapproved by the Dean, the applicant may 
appeal his/her case to the VPAA. 
4. The VPAA may, in turn, endorse the application to the FADECO for appropriate action.

allowance is may also be part of the partial award from FADECO.

be to attend to university business. Consultation must be made with the immediate supervisor about 
the purpose of the leave, the importance and need for the leave and the effect on teaching or work. 
Arrangements should be made as far ahead as practical.

leaves may be approved by the Division Head of the faculty/staff concerned.  Application for leaves 
longer that six months will need the approval of the University President. 
4. On very rare instances other than the foregoing, a special leave of absence may be granted by the 
President, provided that such leave is for the long-range benefit of the University. 
5. Failure to secure approval for an extension of the leave of absence thirty (30) days prior to expiration 
of such leave means termination from the University with loss of benefits and privileges.

Section 2 – Housing 
 
A. Purposes and Policies 
 
Any building constructed by or for Silliman University has the primary purpose of contributing to student 
life or instruction. The University is continuously concerned about housing for its faculty and staff. It will 
exert every reasonable effort to make available or help faculty/staff members obtain suitable housing. 
 
The number of residential houses which the University will maintain on Silliman property will be 
determined by the President, based on recommendations from the Housing Committee. The two criteria to 
be used in determining need for these houses are:  
 
1. Use in connection with student activities, instruction, and/or residence, and  
2. University responsibilities which make it necessary to provide a residence in the University  
 
property. Concerned persons will be asked to live in the University houses to facilitate their  
 
 
work or to help attain the purposes mentioned above. 
 
The office of the President updates the list of positions whose holders are expected to live on the campus 
(within limits of available residences) unless they have their own housing unit. 
 
B. Housing Assignment 
 
The Housing Committee will be guided primarily by the following point system in housing assignment:

kept alive. This means that while no attempt should be made to convert students and faculty to a 
  
82   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
particular institution or form of the Christian faith, a University program for introducing the University 
community (of students, faculty, and staff) to the Christian message is in order. 
 
As a University with this kind of background and continuing commitment, ongoing opportunities for 
religious growth and understanding, such as church services and convocations which undergird all of life, 
including intellectual growth, are provided; and teachers and staff members are encouraged to make use 
of them. Members of the University should be encouraged to grow in their faith, for religious 
understanding is basic to the growth of the total person.

University convocation. An all-university convocation is scheduled at the beginning of each semester and 
whenever there are special or important occasions and/or guest speakers on campus. 
 
All faculty and staff members of the University, representing all divisions, colleges, schools, departments 
and all support services automatically make up the General Faculty and Staff Assembly. Its actions are 
recommendatory in nature. As a body, it is primarily concerned with matters of general interest and 
policies concerning the entire University. No restrictions are placed upon the agenda of their meetings. 
Questions are encouraged and any topic of interest may be discussed and any member may present any 
subject that she/he thinks may be included in the agenda of the next meeting. Assembly actions or 
recommendations shall be presented by the Presiding Officer to the proper administrative bodies in the 
University authorized to act on those matters concerned. 
 
The President, or in his absence, the Officer-In-Charge of the University, shall preside over the meetings.

President or upon the written petition of at least 50 members provided that the purpose is stated in the 
petition.

and full attendance is expected. Active participation in faculty and staff meetings is recorded in the 
personnel file.

secure prior permission from his/her Dean, Director or Supervisor, with the approval of the VPAA, in the 
case of faculty, or the VP for Finance/Administration, in the case of staff. The Dean, Director, or 
Supervisor shall determine the number of units the faculty or staff member may carry, depending upon 
his/her capability, competence, and aptitude, and whether or not the studies will adversely affect his/her 
responsibilities and efficiency as a faculty or staff. 
 
No full-time faculty or staff member of the University and/or its related entities shall be eligible for any

VI.  EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE 
 
The objectives of disciplinary actions must always be positive. They must be educational and corrective. 
It must improve the future actions and behavior of persons rather than to punish him/her for what has 
been done. The stages of punitive discipline imply that stronger penalties are meted for grave or repeated 
offenses. The rationale behind this is to give the person an opportunity for self-correction before more 
serious penalties are imposed and for management to work with an employee to correct infractions. 
 
Due process should always be observed.  Due process is satisfied when a person is notified of the charge 
against him and is given an opportunity to explain or defend himself/herself.  The essence of due process 
is simply to be heard or to have an opportunity to explain one’s side, or an opportunity to seek a 
reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of. 
 
1.0 Stages of Corrective Discipline  
 
1.1 Verbal warning or reprimand 
 
This is the first step in corrective discipline. When an employee fails to maintain a standard or has 
broken a rule, a clear verbal warning is needed. The immediate superior must provide assistance and 
help subordinates prevent the recurrence of the infraction. 
 
 
Hereunder are specific procedural guidelines when conducting this type of discipline: 
 
a. Complaints must be addressed to the immediate superior. 
b. Superior must maintain a record of infractions per employee; 
c. Call erring personnel immediately after the offense is made by the superior must avoid public 
reprimand because this will only generate resentment towards the superior. 
d. Begin the interview with a question or request for information, not accusation. Ask who, 
what, where, when, why, and the how of the problem in a friendly manner; 
e. Allow the erring person to give his side regarding the offence made and give the personnel 
ample time to explain and defend him/her on the evidences you have. 
f. Listen carefully to the person’s reason;  
g. Criticize the wrong doing, not the person; 
  
90   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
h. Emphasize to the personnel that a similar act in the future will be dealt with by a heavier 
action; and 
i. 
Show the person that you have noted the incident and that you have made some allowances 
for honest mistakes. 
 
 
1.2  Written Warning 
 
This is the first formal stage of corrective discipline. This document will be made part of the 
personnel records. The Union shall also be furnished a copy of such warning to its member. This 
document can be presented as evidence later if more serious penalties are imposed. 
 
Hereunder are specific procedural guidelines for the immediate superior when imposing the 2nd stage 
of corrective discipline: 
 
a. Prepare all evidence in writing and check with the person’s 201 file if there has been a similar 
incident in the past and what has been done to correct the infraction; 
b. Inform in writing a Union officer or representative that you are conducting an investigation to 
an infraction made by a member ; 
c. Conduct the disciplinary interview not later than 36 hours after you have learned and/ or have 
known of the infraction committed, unless a longer period is necessary as circumstances may 
warrant; 
d. Conduct the disciplinary interview in a private place, in the presence of a Union 
representative, as the case may be; 
e. Begin the disciplinary interview with a question or a request for information, not an 
accusation. Ask who, what, where, when, why, and the how of the problem in a friendly 
manner; 
f. Allow the erring person to give his/her side. Allow him/ her to explain and defend himself on 
the pieces of evidence you had gathered and the evaluation you have made.  
g. Listen carefully to the person’s reason.  Write down relevant information. 
h. Prepare the Memorandum, focusing on the infraction and the corrective action you have 
decided upon.  Ask the erring employee to receive his/ her copy in the presence of the Union 
representative. 
i. 
After the disciplinary interview, the person responsible for the imposition of the disciplinary 
action shall furnish the HRD Manager, within 24 hours after the interview was made, a copy 
of the written reprimand and a transcript of what transpired during the disciplinary interview. 
 
 
1.3  Disciplinary Suspension 
 
This refers to a temporary break from work by the employee due to a grave violation or repeated 
violations of rule or policy. The length of suspension largely depends on the seriousness of the 
offense. Just like the written warning, suspensions must be documented, and copies shall be furnished 
to the Department of Labor and Employment and Union (if a member thereof). 
 
 
Personnel who are under suspension shall not be allowed within the premises of the unit or 
department where he/she belongs. 
 
When imposing DISCIPLINARY SUSPENSION, persons concerned must refer to the appropriate 
procedures as herein outlined (for all employees other than academic personnel) and the SU-SUFA 
CBA for academic personnel. 
 
 
Hereunder are the procedural guidelines that the immediate superior must observe: 
a. Take the initiative of finding out what has been done in similar cases; 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    91 
b. Prepare all evidence in writing and check with the person’s 201 file if he/ she has committed 
a similar incident in the past and what has been done to correct the infraction; 
c. File the complaint with the HRD Manager, duly supported by evidence. 
d. The immediate supervisor shall explain to the person why the action is necessary. 
e. The supervisor must express his/ her faith and confidence in the person emphasizing that he/ 
she was hired on the basis of her/ her good traits and that it is in the best interest of all 
concerned that such misconduct is not repeated. 
f. Ensure that the decision of the President is faithfully followed by the concerned employee. 
 
Note:  Part of the educational & positive process of corrective discipline is for individuals under 
suspension to meet with a designated counselor/psychologist. 
 
1.4  Preventive Suspension 
 
The president may place any faculty or staff under preventive suspension if his/her employment poses 
a serious and imminent threat to life or property. 
 
Note: If in any case, an employee, staff and faculty is under preventive suspension pending 
investigation, and a resolution has not been reached within the 30-day suspension, the same may be 
extend until the investigation is finished; provided, the respondent shall receive his/her pay for the 
extended period. 
 
1.5  Termination of Employment /Dismissal 
 
The President may terminate the service of any employee (regular or non-regular) for just and 
authorized causes as provided for by law. Due process must always be observed. 
 
Among the just and authorized causes for termination/employment of regular or temporary 
employment by the President are the following: 
 
a. Gross moral delinquency, whether committed inside or outside the campus 
b. Reasons of economy or reorganization as defined by existing labor laws 
c. Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the faculty or staff member 
d. Gross and habitual neglect of duties 
e. Fraud or willful breach of trust by the faculty or staff member

. 
 
2.0 Disciplinary Procedure (regular or non-regular personnel) in the University  
 
a.  The initiative for the action will usually come from the supervisory officer to whom the member 
 
is directly responsible. Complaints against University personnel shall be taken first to this officer. 
b.  The Personnel Committee (for Administrators and staff) or the Disciplinary Panel (for academic 
 
personnel) or the Adjudication Committee (for Sexual Harassment cases) as the case maybe, will 
 
investigate any complaint involving moral character or misconduct before any recommendation is 
 
made to the President. 
c.   The person concerned will be given an opportunity  for a hearing before his/her supervisory 
 
officer, Dean/Director, or any appropriate body designated by the University, unless the same is

XI. SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY 
 
It is the policy of Silliman University to establish and maintain an environment in which the dignity and 
worth of all members of the institution are respected. The University affirms its commitment to provide a 
safe and comfortable learning and working environment for students, faculty and staff, free of sexual 
harassment and all forms of sexual intimidation and exploitation. Sexual harassment in any situation is 
reprehensible and will not be tolerated. It subverts the mission of the University and threatens the careers 
of students, faculty, and staff. Sexual harassment as defined herein constitutes grave misconduct, conduct 
prejudicial to the best interest of the service, or simple misconduct as the case may be, under the 
University Rules and Regulations. Individuals who violate this policy are subject to disciplinary action 
which includes dismissal, expulsion, or other appropriate sanctions. 
 
Definition of Sexual Harassment 
 
Administrators, faculty and staff members may be held liable for sexual harassment. Specifically, the act 
of sexual harassment is committed by an administrator, manager/director, supervisor, teacher, coach, 
trainer, or any other person who, having authority, influence or moral ascendancy over another in a work 
or training or education environment, demands, requests or otherwise requires any sexual favors from a 
subordinate or any student of the University. This is regardless of whether the demand, request or 
requirement for submission is accepted by the object of sexual harassment. 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    97 
 
In a work-related or employment environment, sexual harassment is committed when: 
 
a. The sexual favor is made as a condition in the hiring of said individual; or in granting said individual 
favorable compensation, terms, conditions, promotions or privileges; or the refusal to grant the sexual 
favor results in limiting, segregating or classifying the employee which in any way would 
discriminate, deprive or diminish employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect said 
employee; 
b. The above acts would impair the employee’s rights or privileges under existing labor laws; or 
c. The above acts would result in an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for the employee. 
 
In education or training environment, sexual harassment is committed: 
 
a. Against one who is under the care, custody, or supervision of the offender; 
b. Against one whose education, training, apprenticeship, or tutorship is entrusted to the offender; 
c. When the sexual favor is made a condition to the giving of a passing grade, the granting of honors 
and scholarships or the payment of a stipend, allowance or other benefits, privileges, or 
considerations; or 
d. When the sexual advances result in intimidating an apprentice. 
 
Any person who directs or induces another to commit any act of sexual harassment as herein defined, or 
who cooperates in the commission thereof by another without which it would have not been committed, 
shall also be held liable. 
 
Examples of Sexual Harassment 
 
The following are some examples of behavior that the courts have found to constitute either quid pro quo 
or hostile atmosphere sexual harassment. The list is not inclusive of all behaviors that may be considered 
acts of sexual harassment. Most sexual harassment may either take any or a combination of any two or all 
of the following forms: 
 
A. Verbal – any continual or repeated abuse of a sexual nature despite victim’s warning to the offender, 
including but not limited to: 
 
 
· 
sexual innuendos, comments and suggestive remarks about clothing, or a person’s body; 
 
· 
asking intimate questions on his/her sexual activities; 
 
· 
Touching oneself sexually or rating other students as to sexual activity in front of others;  
 
· 
spreading rumors about or rating other students as to sexual activity or performance; 
 
 
· 
suggestive or insulting sounds;  
 
· 
whistling in a suggestive manner; 
 
 
· 
staring or leering; 
 
 
· 
persistently telling smutty jokes (dirty jokes) to someone who has indicated he or she finds them 
offensive; 
 
 
· 
making obscene or offensive phone calls (text or voice)  
 
· 
sexual propositions, invitations, or other pressure for sex; and 
 
 
· 
implied or overt threats 
 
B. Physical – unwelcome touch on the victim’s body that may include but not limited to 
 
 
 
· 
patting, pinching, feeling, or any other intentional inappropriate touching; 
 
· 
brushing against the body; 
 
 
· 
making obscene or offensive hand or body gestures; 
 
 
· 
attempted or actual kissing; 
 
 
· 
fondling; and 
 
  
98   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
 
· 
sexual intercourse. 
 
C. Written or visual – continual use of the following objects or pictures directed to a specific individual 
or when people cannot reasonably avoid seeing them when shown (list is not inclusive) 
 
 
 
· 
pictures or drawings of a sexual nature; 
 
· 
sexually derogatory pin-ups, posters, cartoons, magazines, or calendars;  
 
· 
messages, words, comments, rhymes, or other writing of a sexually derogatory or suggestive 
nature. 
 
Superior-Subordinate Relationship 
 
Those who supervise or evaluate the work of others, both in academic and employment settings, must 
base their decisions on merits, and must deserve the trust of persons affected by these decisions. To be 
effective, they must be perceived to make their decision fairly and without favoritism. There are special 
risks in any sexual or romantic relationship between individuals in inherently unequal positions, such as 
teacher and student, supervisor and employee, or student resident and the individual who supervises the 
day-to-day living environment. Such relationships may have the effect of undermining the atmosphere of 
trust on which the educational process depends. Implicit in the idea of professionalism is the recognition 
by those in positions of authority that, in their relationship with students, there is always an element of 
power. It is incumbent upon those with authority not to abuse, nor seem to abuse, the power with which 
they are entrusted. 
 
Officers and other members of the teaching staff should be aware that any romantic involvement with 
their student who is under their direct supervision makes them liable for formal action against them even 
if the romantic involvement is initiated by the student. Even when both parties have consented to the 
development of such relationship, it is the officer or instructor who, by virtue of his/her special 
responsibility, will be held accountable for unprofessional conduct. Because graduate students or tutors 
may be less accustomed than faculty members to thinking of themselves as holding professional 
responsibilities, it would be wise for them to exercise personal care in their relationships with students 
whom they instruct or evaluate. 
 
In a personal relationship between an officer and a student for whom the officer has no current 
professional responsibility, the officer should exercise professional conduct and be sensitive to the 
constant possibility that he or she may unexpectedly be placed in a position of responsibility for the 
student’s instruction or evaluation. 
 
The University has no formal policy prohibiting consensual or sexual relationships among faculty, staff or 
students. However, relationships in which one party is in a position to review the work or influence the 
career of the other may provide grounds for complaint when such relationship gives undue access or 
advantage, restricts opportunities, or creates a hostile and unacceptable environment for others. 
Furthermore, circumstances may change and conduct that was previously welcome, may become 
unwelcome. Even when both parties have consented at the outset to a romantic involvement, this past 
consent does not remove grounds for a charge based upon subsequent unwelcome conduct.  
Thus, a faculty member who enters into a sexual relationship with a student (or a supervisor with an 
employee) must realize that, if a charge of sexual harassment is subsequently lodge or filed, it will be 
exceedingly difficult to prove immunity on grounds of mutual consent. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    99 
GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE  
POLICY ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
 
These guidelines provide a variety of options, both formal and informal, for resolving sexual harassment

accused of giving favor to student/subordinate in exchange of sexual favor such as grades or lighter 
academic/work requirement or accused of committing an act that engages sexual intercourse, sexual 
foreplay, rape and any sexual attack regardless of the place where the incident occurred, the conference 
shall be used as a venue in conciliating both parties after the respondent has been made aware of his/her 
unwanted act and has also been warned to refrain from committing the same act in the future. The 
warning has to be made in writing; copy furnished the HRD Office which shall keep the document in the 
201 file of the respondent. 
 
B. Formal Procedure

d. a brief statement of the relevant and material facts 
 
The complainant shall file the written complaint with the office of the respondent’s immediate superior 
with the assistance of his/her chosen advocate within one (1) year from which the act of harassment was

respondent’s receipt thereof. 
 
Where the complaint is not under oath, the complainant shall be summoned by the committee to swear to 
the truth of the allegations of the complaint. In support of the complaint, the complainant may submit any 
evidence she or he has, including affidavits of witnesses, if any, together with the complaint. 
 
The investigation shall be conducted by the Adjudication Committee that will be composed of the

is a faculty member *SUSA representative if the respondent is a staff member) 
2. Administration representative to be appointed by the President 
3. Representative chosen by both Union and Administration  
 
Functions of the Adjudication Committee:

charge or charges and a statement of the relevant facts constituting his/her defense.   
 
In support of the answer, the respondent shall submit any evidence he or she has, including affidavits of 
witnesses, if any, together with the answer. Unless otherwise directed by the Committee, failure of the 
respondent to file an answer or to appear in the investigation shall be construed as a waiver to present 
evidence on his or her behalf. 
 
 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    101 
Hearing of the Case 
 
After all the pleadings have been submitted, the Adjudication Committee shall conduct a hearing not 
earlier than five (5) days nor later than ten (10) days from the date of receipt of the respondent’s answer 
or complainant’s reply if any, and shall terminate such hearing within thirty (30) days from the filing of 
the charges. 
 
The Adjudication Committee shall prepare a report within (15) days after the conclusion of the

If the case against the officer or employee under preventive suspension is not finally decided within a 
period of ninety (90) days after date of suspension, respondent shall be automatically reinstated in the 
service; provided that the delay in the disposition of the case is  not due to the fault, negligence, or 
petition of the respondent.

Conference and approval by the President;  such approval shall be submitted to the Board of 
Trustees (BOT) for information on its next meeting. 
 
2.  Buildings and places on campus or on any property of the University which are used for 
multiple purposes shall be nominated for naming by the President and shall be so named upon 
approval by the BOT. In all instances, the parameters shall be documented to have been met 
by the University’s Department of History and Political Science. 
 
Renaming of Facilities 
There may be a need in the future for existing named facilities to be revitalized, renovated or even 
demolished in order to build newer structures that are more suited to the needs of the University.  There 
may be a need to rename the facility in order to recognize the donors who have made such improvements 
possible.   
The bequest of previous donors is to be remembered.  This may be done through the preservation of the 
original dedication plaque or the naming of a room within the new facility to honor the legacy of their gift. 
In all cases, the University should inform the previous donors of the development plants, and the manner 
in which their legacy is to be remembered. 
Pertinent Board Actions on Naming of Campus Facilities  
Per BOT Action 2008-6 VOTED:  To approve in principle the proposed rationale, guidelines, duties and 
responsibilities of the Memorials Committee for the naming of 
buildings and other facilities of the University and request the same

on the same. (August 29, 2009 Meeting) 
 
ARTICLE IX - PROCUREMENT MANUAL 
Goods, Services, Consultancies 
 
Rationale 
 
In 2003, consistent with the public clamor for the Philippine government to undertake concrete steps to 
curb corruption, the 2003 Government Procurement Reform Act was enacted. This law seeks to cover all 
government purchases, whether domestic or foreign. Although primarily for government, the said law can 
also be made to apply to private corporations.  
 
Silliman University intends to streamline its procurement affairs to (1) achieve maximum savings which 
can be effectively plowed down as additional benefits to- its faculty and staff and strengthen its 
educational programs and facilities, (2) curb any impending incidences of fixing of contracts and contract 
irregularities and allow the Bids and Awards Committee to effectively ascertain such irregularities, and 
(3) allow as many qualified suppliers to participate in the bidding process to make Silliman University the 
recipient of only the most satisfactory among the available goods or services at the most reasonable cost, 
as the case may be. 
 
Description 
 
This is a simple Procurement Manual designed for the procurement affairs of Silliman 
University including its colleges and schools, offices and support units. 
 
Target Audience 
 
This Manual aims to streamline all procurement activities of Silliman University and will 
be the basic tool to assist the Bids and Awards Committee and assist all deans and unit heads in 
their acquisition activities. 
 
Goals and Objectives 
 
This Manual aims to allow the Bids and Awards Committee and department and units 
heads to: 
• Know the basic principles of a sound public procurement system like transparency, 
 
integrity and efficiency; 
• Know the basic principles and processes involving the Philippines' public procurement 
 
system under the new Government Procurement Reform Act, its implementing rules and 
 
regulations other related government issuances;

Content 
 
I. Introduction to public procurement 
 
A. Definitions. 
 
 
 
1. Public procurement 
 
 
This is the process by which government buys goods and services from private   
 
 
companies for the needs of its constituents. 
 
  
118   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
 
 
 
2. Bidding 
 
 
This is the process of knowing which person or company should government 
 
 
buy from for its needed goods and services. Under Philippine law, it is usually 
 
 
given to the one offering the lowest price while meeting the minimum quality 
 
 
requirements. 
 
 
 
3. Bid 
 
 
This is an offer or proposal to enter into a contract with government. It is 
 
 
given by a private company or person, called the bidder, to the government 
 
 
agency who does the bidding. 
 
 
 
4. Bidder 
 
 
This refers to a person who submits the bid either for himself or for another  
 
 
person who has given him or her the authority to do the submission before the 
 
 
government agency concerned. 
 
 
 
5. Goods 
 
 
This refers to all items, supplies, materials and general support services which 
 
 
may be needed by government and its agencies for its activities whether in the 
 
 
nature of equipment, furniture, stationery, materials for construction, or property 
 
 
of any kind, including repair of equipment and furniture, trucking, hauling, 
 
 
janitorial, security, and related services. 
 
 
6. Infrastructure 
 
This includes the construction, improvement, development, destruction repair, or 
maintenance of roads and bridges, railways, airports, seaports, communication facilities, 
irrigation, flood control and drainage, water supply, sanitation, national buildings, school 
buildings, hospital buildings, and other related construction projects of the government. 
 
 
 
7. Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) 
 
 
This is a group of three (3) to five (5) persons who are necessarily employees 
 
 
of the University, appointed by the President. They are in charge of the conduct of 
 
 
bidding for all acquisitions of the University. 
 
 
B. Principles of a Sound Public Procurement System 
 
 
 
• Transparency 
 
 
This is a principle which allows all interested participants (government 
 
 
agency and the private company) to know and understand the processes by 
 
 
which government contracts are awarded. 
 
 
 
 
 
It requires the knowledge of how the system should work and function. 
 
 
Under Philippine law, bidding is done in public. 
 
 
 
• Efficiency 
 
 
This refers to spending the least in buying what is needed. 
 
 
 
• Integrity 
 
 
This involves rules to ensure that graft and corruption is not involved in 
 
 
government purchases. 
 
 
 
• Competition 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    119 
 
 
This ensures that everyone has an equal opportunity to take part in 
 
 
government transactions. 
 
 
 
• Best Value and Customer Satisfaction 
 
 
This ensures that government gets the best value for the taxpayer's money. 
 
 
 
• Uniformity 
 
 
The law should apply to an government purchases and transactions. 
 
C. History of Philippine Public Procurement 
 
Is there a law which applies to government purchases? 
Yes, Republic Act 9184 which is also known as the Government Procurement Reform Act of 
2003. It is the first law which applies to all government purchases whether the national 
government or local government units like provinces, cities or municipalities. 
 
What was government procurement like before Republic Act 9184? 
Since 1901 government purchases of supplies, materials and equipment were done through public 
bidding. The purchase of infrastructure and consulting services were governed by separate laws. 
It was only in 2001 when government decided to put together all procurement rules and 
procedures. Finally, On January 10, 2003 President Arroyo signed into law what is today the 
Government Procurement Reform Act (RA 9184). It repealed all past laws on procurement. 
 
II. The Public Procurement System of the Philippines

Under Philippine law, any person who has enough knowledge on the 
 
 
subject matter of the contract and has no interest in the said contract. 
 
 
The civilian observers find out if the BAC has followed all laws governing 
 
 
government purchases and they recommend points for improvement. 
 
 
 
 
 
They shall include : 
 
 
 
1. a representative from a private group which has knowledge of the 
 
 
 
procurement to be done, for example: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a. for infrastructure projects 
 
 
 
 
• National Constructors Associations 
 
 
 
 
• The Philippine Institute ,of Civil Engineers 
 
 
 
 
 
b. for goods 
 
 
 
 
• a member of the Chamber of Commerce (an organization 
  
120   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
 
 
 
 
of businesspersons) 
 
 
 
 
2. A representative from a non-governmental organization (an organization

procedure or has complied with the law. 
 
 
 
c. Phil-GEPS 
 
 
The central portal that serves as the primary and definitive source of information on all  
 
 
government procurement. This is a website where government can publish what goods,  
 
 
consulting services and infrastructure projects it needs and where suppliers, private  
 
 
contractors and companies can search and view these procurement opportunities   
 
 
including the result. In the full implementation of PhilGEPS, these suppliers may submit  
 
 
their offer bid online. The website address is www.philgeps.net.

Procurement Conference 
A pre-procurement conference is the forum where all persons involved in the 
procurement discuss all aspects of a specific procurement activity, which includes the technical 
specification, the ABC, the applicability and appropriateness of the recommended method of 
procurement and the related milestones, the bidding documents and availability of the pertinent 
budget release for the project. This shall be attended by the BAC, the unit or officials who 
prepared the bidding documents and the draft Invitation to Bid, as well as consultants hired by 
the agency concerned and the representative of the end-user. 
 
A pre-procurement conference is a meeting between the government and any contractor 
interested to bid in a project. In this stage, the government agency confirms whether there is 
money to pay any person who wins the bid and the specific good or service to be bought is 
reviewed. 
 
The pre-procurement conference must be conducted at least seven (7) days before the 
advertisement of the invitation to bid for the general public. 
 
The holding of a pre-procurement conference may not be required for small procurements 
like procurement of goods costing Php lM and below; procurement of infrastructure projects 
costing Php2M and below; and the procurement of consulting services costing Php 1M and 
below.

Silliman University. 
 
Bidding Documents 
 
Bidding documents refers to documents issued by the Procuring Entity as the basis for 
bids, furnishing all information necessary for a prospective bidder to prepare a bid for the 
infrastructure projects, goods and/or consulting services, required by the Procuring entity. These 
shall clearly and adequately define, among others: 
 
a) The objectives, scope and expected outputs and/or results of the proposed contract;

be procured; 
c) Expected contract duration, the estimated quantity in the case of the procurement of Goods, 
delivery schedule and/or time frame; 
d) The obligations, duties and/or functions of the winning bidder; 
e) The minimum eligibility requirements of bidders, such as track record to be determined by 
the Dean, Department Head, Unit Head or Head of Office. 
 
Pre-Bid Conference 
 
The pre-bid conference is a meeting between the University's representatives and the 
prospective bidders where they discuss matters related to the procurement, including rules and 
regulations. 
 
It must be held for contracts with Approved Budget of at least One Million Pesos (P 
l Million) and upon written request of a prospective bidder. 
 
The pre-bid conference must be held at least twelve (12) calendar days before the 
deadline for the submission of bids. 
 
Any prospective bidder intending to submit a bid must make a written request for clarification to 
the BAC at least ten (10) calendar days before the deadline for the submission and receipt of bids. 
The BAC must answer the questions by issuing a supplemental/bid bulletin to be made available 
to all those who have properly secured the bidding documents at least seven (7) calendar days 
before the deadline for the submission and receipt of bids. 
  
124   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
 
The Procuring Entity may, at its own initiative, also issue supplemental/bid bulletins for purposes 
of clarifying any provision of the bidding documents not later than seven (7) calendar days before 
the deadline for the submission and receipt of bids. Any change in the bidding documents must be 
labeled as an "AMENDMENT." 
 
The supplemental/bid bulletin should be posted on the website of Silliman University 
within the same timetable. 
 
Submission of Bids and Bid Opening 
 
Each bidder shall submit two sealed envelopes for the bid-{l) one for the technical 
component containing all relevant documents and (2) for the financial component which includes 
the price for the project. The price must not go beyond the approved budget for the contract. 
 
Bid Evaluation 
 
This is the ranking of bids. The purpose of bid evaluation is to determine which of the 
companies who submitted meets the satisfactory quality at reasonable cost and documentary 
requirements under the law. Once met, the bidder is called Most Satisfactory Calculated Bid 
(MSCB) for goods and infrastructure and for Consulting Services, Best Calculated Bid 
("BCB"). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Guidelines for Bid Evaluation 
1. The BAC must not go beyond the ABC set for goods, infrastructure or consulting 
service being evaluated. 
 
2. The BAC may look into the quality of the goods, infrastructure or consulting 
service being evaluated in relation to its price. Preference must be given to the lowest price 
which exhibits satisfactory quality. 
 
3. In evaluating quality, the BAC may call upon experts from within the University 
or persons within the Dumaguete community to assist it in its judgment. A choice of a bidder who 
is has not offered the lowest price for goods and infrastructure must include an explanation on the 
reason for such choice, specifically in relation to quality. For consulting services, the BAC must 
choose the bidder with the most qualification at reasonable cost.  
 
4. At all meetings, there shall be a representative from the Accounting Department 
of the College of Business Administration to check on the fmancial implications of the proposed 
procurement. 
 
Post-Qualification 
 
MSCB 
Bidder 2 
Bidder 1 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    125 
 
Post-qualification is the stage where the MSCB for goods and infrastructure projects or 
the BCB for consulting services is checked and validated to ensure that it has passed all the 
requirements and qualification as stated in the Bidding Documents. 
What happens if the Most Satisfactory Calculated Bid (MSCB) for goods and  
infrastructure and for Consulting Services, Best Calculated Bid ("BCB") does not meet all 
the criteria? 
 
The BAC shall look at the bidder with the second MSCB or BCB. If the bidder with the second 
Most Satisfactory Calculated Bid (MSCB) for goods and infrastructure and for Consulting 
Services, Best Calculated Bid ("BeB") does not meet the criteria also, the same procedure shall be 
repeated until the Most Satisfactory Calculated Bid (MSCB) for goods and infrastructure and for 
Consulting Services, Best Calculated Bid ("BCB") is finally determined. 
 
 
Failure of Bidding 
 
There is a Failure of Bidding if a) no bids are received; b) no bid qualifies as the Most 
Satisfactory Calculated Bid (''MSCB'') for goods and infrastructure and for Consulting Services, 
Best Calculated Bid ("BCB"); or c) when the bidder with the Most Satisfactory Calculated Bid 
(MSCB) for goods and infrastructure and for Consulting Services, Best Calculated Bid 
("BCB") refuses to accept the award with no valid justification. 
 
The contract shall be re-advertised and re-bid. The BAC shall observe the same process 
and set the new periods according to the same rules during the first bidding. 
 
The post-qualification process must be conducted and completed within seven (7) 
calendar days from date of determination of the MSCB and BCB. 
 
Award 
 
The contract is awarded after the approval of the University President upon the 
recommendation of the BAC. This is done within 15 days from the determination of the MSCB 
or BCB. 
 
The winning bidder and Silliman University must enter into a contract immediately all 
documents needed for the contract have been submitted. The parties must sign the contract 
within ten (10) calendar days from receipt by the winning bidder of the Notice of Award.

1. Scope: This shall apply to purchase of books, office and school supplies, travel tickets, 
hotel bookings, and other materials subject to a maximum allowable amount per requisition. 
2. Purpose: It can facilitate liquidation and reduce numerous processing of cash advances. 
 
3. Control: 
• The University must set up maximum allowable amount per requisition. 
• Each purchase requisition must first be approved by the Treasurer subject to oversight by the 
Audit Committee. The reason for such purchase must be expressly stated. 
• The University must designate an authorized person to hold the credit card. Not every 
employee can have access to the card. The person authorized must have no access to the 
preparation and recording in the books of accounts of the University. 
• Each requisition must be in the name of the University, and must be reviewed by the Treasurer 
for accuracy and authenticity. 
• Each requisition must be reconciled at month end to avoid incurring overdue obligations. 
• Each shipments of goods received must be reconciled with the amount paid in the receipts to 
ensure that cash is disbursed to bona fide liabilities. 
 
4. Other benefits: 
• Less transactional costs. 
• Fees charged by travel agencies are higher than online purchase of travel tickets. 
• Facilitate timely processing of hotel reservations 
• Facilitate prompt payment to supplier. 
• Facilitate prompt shipping and delivery of supplies" and other materials. 
 
V. Red Flags in the Bidding Process 
 
a. Same Supplier/Contractor Gets the Award Repeatedly 
 
Philippines procurement law promotes the principles that each interested person or corporation 
can have equal opportunity to any government contract. If a bidder is awarded the contract 
several times, there is a suspicion that may have been given special consideration over and above 
all others because of his relationship with the members of the Bids and Awards Committee. It can 
also indicate that there is a possibility of corruption. If this happens, the observers who are 
present during the bidding should increase their vigilance to make sure that there is no special 
consideration. 
 
For purposes of review, an internal audit committee must be particularly alert for: 
• Multiple sole source awards to the same firm, especially in amounts just under the maximum 
sole source amount; 
• Multiple contract awards to the same firm, in amounts just under a more competitive 
• procurement threshold; 
• Contracts that are split into several smaller contracts to avoid upper level review or 
competitive bidding. 
• Also be alert for a small firm that receives multiple contracts for a wide variety of disparate 
goods or services, which can indicate it is a broker or shell company. 
• controlled by a project official. 
• Do a public record and media background check on such a company if concerns arise.  
 
Each supplier/contractors that the University has dealt with must be enrolled in a Supplier Master 
List containing their respective details. The University may conduct a supplier/contractor audit to 
identify possible collusion, conflict of interests and fictitious suppliers/bidders. 
 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    127 
b. No Posting of Invitations to Bid or Failure to Provide Adequate Notice to Bid 
 
If a project is made without an invitation to bid that is posted as required and the contract is 
awarded to a person, there is a violation of the procurement laws because the opportunity was not 
made known to all. Likewise, project officials may deliberately fail to provide adequate notice for 
companies to prepare bids or expression of interest to benefit a favored contractor. This creates a 
suspicion that the contractor is favored by the University over and above all others or that project 
officials probably received a special gift in cash or kind to favor the contractor. Observers in 
actual bidding should ask for a copy of the invitation to bid to make sure the posting requirement 
has been made. As a review, it is required that the Invitation to Bid be published in a newspaper 
of general circulation, at least once. Inadequate notice can include: 
 
• Failure to allow enough time to prepare bids or proposals; 
• Refusing to grant reasonable requests for extension of time to prepare bids or proposals; 
• Publishing the notice during a holiday period, limiting the time available to prepare bids; 
• Limiting the notice to small, local publications or other publications of limited circulation; 
• Providing inadequate or misleading information in the published notices, e.g., failing to state 
the correct time and place to submit bids; 
• Holding pre-bid conferences too close to the bid due date to permit appropriate modifications 
to bids; 
• Failure to provide notice of changes to the bid specifications tall bidders; 
• Failure to provide any notice at all and preparing fictitious ad copy to conceal the scheme. 
 
A copy of the Invitation to Bid must be submitted to the Audit Committee on the day of 
advertisement. 
 
c. No posting of Bid Bulletins 
 
All changes in the invitation to bid or bid opportunities made after pre-bid conference 
when required should also follow this procedure. Notice of the changes is material to the 
bidding process, because the bidders who have submitted before the issuance of the 
Supplemental Bid Bulletin are still allowed to modify their bids to fit the new requirements. 
Without the issuance of the Supplemental Bid Bulletin, the concept of fair competition would 
be a mockery. 
 
The Supplemental Bid Bulletin must be duly certified signed by the BAC Chairman. It 
must be issued within 7 calendar days before deadline for the submission and receipt of bid. 
 
d. No pre-bid conference 
 
A pre-bid conference is required for purchases of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos 
(P500,OOO)and above. It is held at least twelve (12) calendar days before the deadline for the 
submission of bids. The significance in conducting a pre-bid conference is to check the 
availability of appropriation and approved budget on the contract. 
 
Any person observing the bidding can ask for information if this has been done. A bid 
bulletin, if any, shall be posted/issued within this period but not later than seven (7) calendar 
days before the deadline for submission of bids. ' 
 
For purposes of review, the audit committee shall obtain a copy of the Minutes of pre-bid 
conference to verify whether a pre-bid conference has been conducted. The date of approval 
of the Minutes of pre-bid conference must not be later than (3) calendar days after the day of 
pre-bid conference.

e. No opening of bids in public 
 
Transparency is shown through the presence and participation of observers and bidders in 
all stages of the procurement process. The point of opening the sealed bids is one of the most 
important steps of the bidding process because it reveals who among the bidders met the 
requirements. If the opening of bids is done privately, there is no transparency which may 
make the bidding questionable. 
 
Non transparent or deficient bid opening procedures include: 
• Non-public bid opening; 
• Not all bids are opened at the same time; 
• Improper acceptance of a late bid or late discounts; 
• Changes to bids after other bid prices are known; 
• Intimidation of bidders to prevent the submission of bids. 
 
Such abuses can be used to manipulate bid prices or to exclude qualified bidders, often as 
the result of corruption. 
 
f. No announcement of most satisfactory complying bid 
 
Announcement affords notice to all others that they lost to the most satisfactory bidder. It 
therefore allows the other bidders to verify "on the spot" whether or not their respective bids 
are indeed higher than the declared lowest bidder and if the lowest bidder met the minimum 
requirements under the law, 
 
g. Award of contract to Bids and Awards Committee Member's Relative 
 
This is a very clear conflict of interest. It is exactly what the law wants to avoid- that bids 
are awarded to those who are close to officers and employees of the procuring entity who 
have direct access to information that may substantially affect the results of the bidding. This 
limits competition and increases the risk of corruption. 
 
The University may require an Annual Conflicts of Interest Disclosure to be applied to 
the BAC members as a confirmation that they had understood their responsibilities and has 
complied with the University Procurement Policy. The referenced relationship must be 
reviewed and approved by the President and is subject to oversight by the Audit Committee. 
 
h. Winning bid too low 
 
The reason why the University must come up with the Approved Budget for the Contract 
(ABC) is to set the reasonable amount that it can pay for its projects. It reflects the most 
advantageous price for the University and makes sure that the money is spent wisely. When 
the bid becomes too low, the quality of the project may suffer. , 
 
i. Bid accepted after close of bids; BAC accepts modifications of bids after the close of 
bids 
 
Acceptance of bids after the deadline of bid submission creates the suspicion of favoritism for the 
contractor who submitted it. The deadline for submission determines the closure of the bids, 
where no one is allowed to submit anymore. Qualified bidders, in the case of procurement of 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    129 
infrastructure and consulting services, are already determined even before the bids are closed. 
Only they can submit their respective bids. If anyone is allowed to submit a bid after its closure, 
his eligibility was surely not pre-determined. The integrity of the entire bidding process will be 
compromised. 
 
The BAC must observe the maximum of 45 days from the last day of posting of the Invitation to 
Bid up to the deadline for submission and receipts of bids.

GUIDELINES ON THE REVIEW OF AGREEMENTS 
AND NOTARIZATION OF DOCUMENTS 
 
I. General Matters 
 
As a matter of policy, regardless of origin of preparation or negotiation, all contracts, agreements and legal 
instruments involving the University must undergo review and clearance by the Office of the General 
Counsel before it can be endorsed to the Office of the President for approval and signature. 
 
No document or instrument shall or can obligate the University or any of its units or programs, much less 
to release any fund in its legal possession, unless the document or instrument has been processed and signed 
as required in this protocol and university policy.  
 
This document establishes the process for the legal review and authorization of contracts and agreements 
to be entered into by the University. In addition, it also specifies the documents that the Office of the 
General Counsel can notarize. 
 
II. Contract/Agreement Review Guidelines 
 
a. General 
 
The Office of the General Counsel is tasked to make a review of all University contracts/agreements. For 
the purposes of these guidelines, a “University contract” is defined as an agreement between two (2) or 
more parties, one of which is the University, intended to have legal effect or be otherwise recognized by 
law.  
 
Examples of University contracts include, among others:  
 
Memorandum of Agreement 
 
Memorandum of Understanding or Cooperation 
 
Affiliation Agreements 
 
Leases of Property and 
 
Student or Faculty Exchange Agreements 
 
b. Preparation of Contracts/Agreements 
 
Offices of the University President and Vice Presidents 
 
The Office of the General Counsel serves directly the Office of the University President as well as the 
Offices of the University Vice-Presidents. 
 
The Office of the General Counsel shall assist in the preparation of contracts/agreements directly involving 
the said offices. 
 
Colleges, Departments And Other Units  
 
Contracts/Agreements proposed by colleges, departments and other units to be entered into by the 
University should follow the applicable template prepared by the Office of the General Counsel. It shall be 
the responsibility of the college, department or unit concerned to provide and fill in the necessary details in 
the applicable template. 
 
 
  
132   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
c. Review of Contracts/Agreements by Office of the General Counsel 
 
After the college, department or unit concerned has filled out the applicable template, the draft 
contract/agreement shall be submitted to theOffice of the General Counsel for review. 
No contract or agreement can be endorsed to theUniversity Presidentfor approval and signature unless the 
same has been reviewed and cleared by the Office of the General Counsel. 
 
d. Timing Matters 
 
Colleges, Departments or Units shall allow a seven (7) working day review period from the date of receipt 
by the Office of the General Counsel of the proposed contract/agreement. In some cases, however, the 
actual review may take a shorter or longer period of time. A number of factors influence the amount of time 
required for the Office of the General Counsel to complete its review. To obtain the most expeditious review 
of a non-template agreement (for cases where the contract is prepared by the other party), every possible 
effort should be made to submit the draft agreement in Microsoft Word .doc format.  
 
e. Agreement Templates and Cover Sheet 
 
The Office of the General Counsel has designed a number of agreement templates and a Cover Sheet to be 
used in the review process. Use of a template agreement (where applicable) greatly facilitates the review 
process. University template agreements should be used whenever possible. Only those University 
agreements prepared by the other party can use a different format.  
 
The Cover Sheet must accompany every draft agreement sent to the General Counsel for review. The Cover 
Sheet must be fully completed and signed by the person submitting the draft agreement for review. The 
Cover Sheet requires, among other things, the employee to certify that he or she has read the draft 
agreement, understands its terms and has followed all applicable University procedures regarding 
agreements. The absence of a Cover Sheet shall be sufficient basis to return the draft agreement to the 
concerned office or department.  
 
All draft agreements with Cover Sheet must be submitted in hard copy to the Office of the General Counsel 
at 2/F Villareal Hall. A soft copy in Microsoft Word.doc format must also be emailed to 
legalcounsel@su.edu.ph. 
 
f. Signature Authority 
 
In general terms, the Board of Trustees has granted the President the authority to sign agreements relating 
to the operation of the University. Prior to approval and signature by the President, the office or department 
concerned must first secure the signature of the General Counsel, the VPAA, VPFA and VPD. The head of 
the office or department concerned may sign as one of the witnesses. 
 
If any employee or officer without the requisite signatory authority signs an agreement, that employee or 
officer may face personal liability for the draft agreement. “Personal liability” can include responsibility 
for all costs and expenses associated with the agreement, including attorneys’ fees and other expenses. The 
employee or officer may also be held liable for violation of applicable University rules and regulations. 
 
III. Notarial Services Guidelines 
 
 
The Office of the General Counsel offers limited notary services for the following documents: 
 
 
University contracts as defined in this policy 
 
Affidavit of Change of Grade 
 
Affidavit of Completion 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    133 
 
Certifications from the Registrar’s Office such as those required for Board/Bar Exam 
Applications 
 
The Office of the General Counsel will retain two original copies of the notarized documents. Offices, 
departments and personnel are therefore requested to prepare the appropriate number of copies of the 
documents before submitting them to the Office of the General Counsel for notarization.  
 
In compliance with Philippine law, the parties are required to produce to the notary public evidence of 
identity in the form of a current document issued by the government. This document must contain both the 
photo and signature, a copy of which must be attached to all documents that are to be notarized. 
 
Only original documents can be notarized, thus, the General Counsel will not notarize photocopies.  
 
Unless otherwise indicated above, the General Counsel will not prepare the documents subject for 
notarization. Kindly secure and prepare the documents to be notarized.

II. HISTORY  
 
Silliman University Church traces its roots to the early Presbyterian mission that laid the cornerstone 
of Silliman Institute in 1901. The UCCP is a permanent corporate member of  the Board of Trustees 
of Silliman University and Silliman University Church maintains its relationship with the UCCP 
through its membership in the Negros District Conference. 
 
Silliman University Church is the campus church of Silliman University established as an integral 
part of the educational curriculum at the time of the founding of Silliman Institute in 1901, and 
organized into a campus church in 1916. 
 
Silliman University Church is called to serve the community of Silliman University students, faculty 
and staff and their dependents, alumni and friends and neighbors, regardless of their denominational 
and religious affiliations. As such it is given the autonomy to make decisions on internal ecclesiastical 
(liturgical and prophetic) matters, define its ministerial and pastoral direction, and raise operational 
resources within the boundaries spelled out in this Manual of Silliman University Church. 
 
Silliman University Church shall employ all effective means to integrate its programs into the total 
life of the University so that the church can be an effective instrument through which the University 
can fulfill its responsibilities to the spiritual life of the University community. As an official entity of 
the University, and under the organizational, institutional and legal auspices of its Board of Trustees, 
it is amenable to having its program studied and evaluated by the University administration and 
accepts University appointees to church committees;  it is ready to receive guidance from pertinent 
University bodies and entities on how its ministry might prove more effective in Silliman University. 
 
Silliman University Church shall observe and manifest in form and practice a manner of church polity 
and governance and of worship and sacrament that are consistent with that of the policies, programs 
and standards of Silliman University and of the UCCP as an ecclesiastical body.   As a ministry under 
the auspices of the evangelical apostolate of Silliman University, deviations from the UCCP 
Constitution and By-Laws that are apparent in this Manual have been mutually agreed upon and 
accepted by Silliman University Church, the Silliman University Board of Trustees, and the United 
Church of Christ in the Philippines, as being necessary to make Silliman University Church a special 
UCCP ministry of Silliman University for its faculty, staff, students and alumni and their families, 
friends and neighbors. 
 
The Church is the universal fellowship of love and sharing, created and empowered by the Holy 
Spirit; the living community of those who have committed themselves to Jesus Christ as Lord and 
Savior and so partake in the eternal life of Christ by the saving acts of God, yet recognizing their 
weakness and sinfulness, constantly seek God’s mercy and continually strive to grow into Christ-like 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    139 
maturity; the household of faith devoted to the worship of God as a grateful response to his love and 
grace; witnessing community sent by God into the world as an instrument of His redemptive love to 
demonstrate the life of love through humble service; to proclaim God’s word; to preach the Gospel of 
reconciliation through Jesus Christ, calling all persons to repentance and discipleship, and to declare 
God’s complete sovereign rule in the lives of people and society looking forward to the fulfillment of 
His kingdom which has no end. 
 
III. STATEMENT OF FAITH* 
 
WE BELIEVE    In One God; Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer, who provides order, purpose, meaning 
and fulfillment to all creation. That in Jesus Christ, who was born of Mary, God became human and is 
Sovereign Lord of life and history. That in the Holy Spirit, God is present in the world, empowering and 
guiding believers to understand and live out their faith in Jesus Christ. 
 
WE BELIEVE    That persons are created in the image of God and destined to live in community with 
God, with other persons and with all creation. That, by disobedience, they have become sinful, but, by 
grace through faith, they are redeemed through Jesus Christ. That being entrusted with God’s creation, 
they are called to participate in the establishment of a just and compassionate social order.  
 
WE BELIEVE    That the Church is the one body of Christ, the whole community of persons reconciled 
to God through Jesus Christ and entrusted with God’s ministry. 
 
WE BELIEVE    That the Holy Bible is a faithful and inspired witness to God’s self-revelation in Jesus 
Christ and in history to illumine, guide, correct, and edify believers in their faith and witness. 
 
WE BELIEVE    God is at work, to each person a new being in Christ, and the whole world, God’s 
Kingdom – in which love, justice and peace prevail. The Kingdom of God is present where faith in Jesus 
Christ is shared, where healing is given to the sick, where food is given to the hungry, where light is 
given to the blind, where liberty is given to the captive and oppressed. 
 
WE BELIEVE    The resurrection of Jesus Christ has overcome the power of death and gives assurance 
of life after death. And we look forward to His coming again in all fullness and glory to make all creation 
new and to gather all the faithful under God’s Kingdom. AMEN.

Once the compliant is brought to the proper office, the head of the SGC makes a series of follow-
ups to ensure that the action is done.  
 
If no action is taken by the office concerned, the SGC head may bring up the matter to the higher 
office, this time, with an added complaint of inaction by the lower unit head concerned.

“NC” or “NG” grade is permanent and cannot be subsequently changed due to the lapse of the prescribed 
period of completing the requirements.  
 
The letter “W” shows that the student has dropped a course with the written permission of his/her 
Dean/Director/Principal.  If a student drops a course without the written permission of his Dean, the grade 
for the course automatically becomes “F”.  “WF” is recorded when a student officially withdraws from 
the course but is failing at the time the withdrawal was made. 
 
In order to graduate, a minimum cumulative quality point average (CQPA) is required at the end of the 
term in which the student completes his course in the following:  Baccalaureate programs, 2.0; Law, 2.3; 
Medical School, 2.5; Master’s program, 3.0; and Doctorate programs, 3.5.    
 
As additional requirement for graduation and progression in the degree program, all designated 
undergraduate professional courses or major subjects must have the minimum QPA set by the college and 
approved by the Academic Council. 
 
All courses under the master’s and doctorate programs must have a minimum grade of 3.0 and 3.5, 
respectively.  
 
B. Guidelines on the Change of Grade 
 
DECS Provisions on the Change of Grade 
 
 
DEC Memo s 1959 says that no additional final exam can be given to a student for purposes of 
increasing his grade. 
 
DECS Regional Memo #42, s. 1987, “Request for correction of grade . . . may be entertained by 
this office only if they are due to inadvertent clerical errors subject to verification by a DECS 
supervisor. 
 
C. Grounds for Change of Grade 
 
 
Change of grade is allowed on the following reasons: 
 
Error in the entry of scores or grades 
  
188   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
 
Error of computation 
 
D.  Allowable Period for Change of Grade 
 
A change of grade is allowed within three weeks from date of the final submission of grades to the 
department concerned to give time for the student to question entries of teacher and for committee to 
deliberate.  Once the grades are submitted by the Dean to the Registrar, the teacher can no longer change 
the marks at his/her discretion.  The submitted grades are no longer within the teacher’s “turf”.  They are 
now outside of his/her authority or jurisdiction to change or revise them.  To effect the change, the teacher 
must go through the procedure as outlined below. (MORPHE, p 541)  
 
E.  The Procedure 
 
 
The complainant (student, faculty, dean or parent) submits a written complaint addressed to the 
teacher concerned with copies furnished to the department chairperson, dean, and Registrar’s 
Office. 
 
Upon receipt of the letter of complaint, the department chairperson shall convene a committee 
composed of all the faculty members of the department and the dean.  The student shall be invited 
to attend committee meetings. 
 
Investigation shall include scrutiny and discussion of all entries of grades or scores up to the final 
exam.  These data should be given to the committee prior to the meeting to allow time for the 
members to study. 
 
If accepted, report of the change of grade addressed to the Registrar noted by the dean shall 
include a written explanation by the teacher who allowed a change of grade, supporting papers 
and a statement of the committee action. 
 
Any petition for change of grade will no longer be accepted when the report on promotion (Form 
XIX) have been submitted by the Registrar to the CHED.  
 
These guidelines are to be followed effective April 1990. 
 
C.  Incomplete Grades 
 
An “INC” (Incomplete) mark indicates that the student has not completed all course requirements due to 
excusable reason, such as, sickness, emergency, or accident. (Section 109, Article XXII, MORPHE, p. 
553.)   
 
The student must complete the requirements within the semester following that in which the course 
was taken.  Otherwise, the grade automatically becomes “NC” for “No Credit” or “NG” for “No Grade”.  
Such a grade is permanent and cannot be subsequently changed.  (Section 109, Article XXII, MORPHE, 
p. 553.)  
 
In removing the “Inc.”, the student must present to the teacher a receipt from the Business and Finance 
Office indicating payment of the completion fee. 
 
An “Inc.” mark given for reasons other than failure to complete course requirements shall not be subject 
to the P25.00 completion fee. 
 
D.  Preparation of Grades 
 
All teachers should prepare the grades and submit them on time to the Office of the Dean and the 
Registrar and Admissions Office. 
 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    189 
Preparation of grades refers to the construction of examination papers, test administration, correcting of 
test papers, computation of the grades, preparation of class cards and grading sheets, including the 
preparation of F-138 for Elementary and High School. 
 
E.  Submission of Grades 
 
Grades must be reported to the department chair or, if no department, directly to the dean or director of 
the college or school within five (5) working days of the administration of the mid-term and final 
examinations.  The grades are encoded in the database to give time for the student to view and question 
on the entries.   The student is given three (3) weeks upon submission of the grades to question any error 
found in the entries.  
 
The Registrar will be responsible for the official release of final grades to students or to their parents or 
guardians. 
 
Mid-term and final grades of non-graduating students must be in the hands of the office of Registrar not 
later than ten days from the examination dates.  Appropriate sanctions for violating these rules shall be 
done by the Academic Council. 
 
By reason of the type and nature of examination given in these schools, the Graduate School and Divinity 
School are allowed twenty (20) days, and the College of Law thirty (30) days, from the date the 
examination is given. 
 
Failure to submit grades on time shall be subject to a fine of P5.00 per day of delay.  All fines are credited 
to the college/school/unit concerned. 
 
All deans and directors are enjoined to enforce these rules strictly. 
 
 
Section 6 - ACADEMIC PROBATION 
 
A student who does not get the required QPA of 2.0 is placed on academic probation during the 
succeeding semester with these conditions: 
 
 
The student may be required to repeat certain subjects, or carry a reduced load to improve or earn 
quality points. 
 
The student must not incur any unexcused absences from regular classes, his college’s assembly 
or the University convocation. 
 
The student is ineligible to represent the university in any public performance or activity, or hold 
any major office without his Dean’s permission. 
 
A student on an academic probation must attain the minimum QPA in the following semester. If he 
cannot get the required QPA, he would be dropped from the University. This action is automatic unless 
the college, or faculty, or the designated committee decides to extend the probation period. 
 
Section VII - EXAMINATION 
 
All students are expected to take the preliminary, mid-term and final examinations at the time scheduled 
by their respective Dean’s Office. If the student fails to take these exams for no justifiable reason, he is 
fined Php60.00 for each examination missed. His Dean shall determine if the reason is justifiable or not. 
 
 
 
  
190   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
Section VIII - ATTENDANCE 
 
Students are expected to attend all classes. Work covered during any absence, excused or unexcused, is 
incurred only for valid reasons. The teacher concerned will determine the validity of the absence. Three 
unexcused absences may be incurred and the rest of the 20 percent allowed by the Commission on Higher 
Education (CHED) must be excused, incurred, only for valid reasons. 
 
Permission to leave the campus for activities must be secured in advance from the Dean, and, if the 
student lives in a dormitory, from the Office of Student Organizations and activities Division (SOAD) 
and the Student Housing and Residence, Student Personnel Services. Otherwise, excuse for such absence 
immediately preceding or following holidays can be secured only from the Dean. If excused or unexcused 
absences are already excessive, the instructor may recommend to the Dean that a student be given a grade 
of “F.” Students must attend first class sessions in any course at the beginning of the semester and classes 
immediately before and after long vacations. 
 
Section VIII - RECOGNITION OF CREDITS EARNED ELSEWHERE 
 
Generally, credits for work done elsewhere are accepted, provided the student obtains the minimum 
average grade required for the program. Students claiming advanced standing must submit a complete 
copy of their school records long before the start of the semester in which they wish to enroll. In some 
cases, advanced credits are accepted only after passing a validating examination that usually covers 
English, Biology, Chemistry, Logic, Physics, Mathematics, and Accounting.  
 
Section VIII - SUMMER STUDY IN OTHER INSTITUTIONS 
 
Students must obtain permission from their respective Deans before taking summer courses in other 
institutions. When credits are desired for major courses, they must secure approval from the department 
chairman. Only students with a minimum cumulative QPA of 2.0 will be allowed to transfer summer 
credits from schools whose educational standards are considered at par with Silliman standards.  
 
Permission to take summer courses elsewhere will be granted only for courses not offered in Silliman 
University.  
 
Section IX - APPLICATION FOR DEGREES 
 
Application for graduation must be filed with the Registrar’s Office in the first semester of the senior 
year. Application forms are available at the Office of the Registrar & Admissions or at the 
Directors/Deans offices. A student with “INC” grades prior to the semester in which he expects to 
graduate cannot be considered a candidate for graduation. Any “INC” grade in the student’s final 
semester which is not removed before commencement will bar him from graduation.  
 
Section X - LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
 
A petition for leave of absence must be filed with student’s Dean. A copy of the petition must also be 
furnished the Registrar. Before the petition can be granted, tuition and all fees must be paid for the entire 
semester in which the leave is sought. Clearance from the university is also required. No leave of absence 
for an indefinite period will be granted. 
 
Request for leave of absence are granted only in cases of illness. Fees paid for the interrupted period will 
be applied in the semester immediately following plus the difference. 
 
 
 
  
UNIVERSITY MANUAL    191 
Section XII - COURSE LOAD 
 
Regular students in undergraduate courses must take the full load or number of units prescribed for a 
particular term, except for:  
 
 
Students with either work grants or assistantships; 
 
Students on academic probation, who may be made to carry no less than 15 units a semester. 
 
A regular student who drops almost all courses, either officially or unofficially, retaining a load of less 
than 15 units will be allowed to finish the term. However, he will be refused admission in the succeeding 
semester. 
In the case of students failing in courses that are pre-requisite to the other courses and who may not be 
allowed by the college to proceed with their studies until those deficiencies are removed, these students 
should be made to cross-register for courses on other colleges in the university so that they may be able to 
comply with the minimum requirement of 15 units per term. 
 
Overload or extra units may be allowed to a candidate for graduation only during the last term of his/her 
course. A graduating the student requesting for an overload must meet the grade requirement of the 
department. A letter request for an overload must be filed addresses to the Commission on Higher 
Education through the Registrar with the approval of the Dean. 
 
These policies are also the bases for determining whether a student should be allowed to continue living 
in any of the university dormitories.

in the course syllabus.  If it is necessary to schedule these trips at times when the student has other 
regularly scheduled classes, excuses may be granted from these classes provided regulations have been 
complied with.  It is of course understood that the student make up for any work missed.

Procedure for Processing of Activity Permit for Major Off-campus Trips 
 
Brief Rationale  
 
Part of Silliman pedagogy is to expose its students to actual application of theories and concepts as well 
as let them personally appreciate and experience course-related sites and events.  Likewise, students are 
encouraged to participate in athletics, cultural affairs and other invitational competitions as part of their 
holistic development.  Thus, students are allowed to go out of campus to experience all these.   
However, the university is not remiss of its responsibility towards the welfare of its students hence; 
certain protocol has to be observed before off-campus trips are allowed; especially because the students 
will also be exposed to risks from fortuitous events and activity related misfortunes.

Silliman University students, faculty, and campus organizations, whether on or off-campus. The 
Activities Calendar also contains all activities held on campus by non- Silliman University groups. The 
record is kept so that these activities may be properly spaced; rooms and equipment as needed are 
provided and available; and the events may be given the appropriate publicity through the Silliman 
website, the Weekly Sillimanian, and posters. 
 
The Activities Calendar is kept in the Student Organizations and Activities Division of the Office of 
Student Services, and final arrangements for holding any activity or series of activities are made there. 
 
 
  
204   UNIVERSITY MANUAL 
 
Scheduling of Activities 
 
The Student Organizations and activities Division reviews the program of the student organization 
reserving a date or a number of dates. All planned activities of registered campus organizations are

Recognized student organizations are entitled to protected dates. Protected dates are dates in the Activities 
Calendar reserved exclusively for a certain organization or dates when student activities are not allowed. 
Protection will be granted on the basis of the nature of the program and the degree of student 
involvement. 
 
A long-range protected reservation is tentative and must be reconfirmed by the entity two weeks before 
the activity; otherwise the date will be made available to other groups. 
 
Requests should be made in writing. Reservations for protected dates will be on a first-come, first-served 
basis, except when the date proposed coincides with the date of an important University-wide activity, in 
which case the latter takes precedence. 
Weekends scheduled for University or special church programs, the week before and during the final 
examinations, are protected. 
 
Processing of Permits for Activities 
 
All activities sponsored by registered student organizations shall have the place, date, and chaperon 
approved in advance by the Student Organizations and Activities Division. CSO member organizations

approval. Application forms to hold an activity are available at the SOAD and the CSO offices. 
 
It is expected of all registered student organizations to assign one member, preferably the president or 
secretary, to prepare and follow up applications to hold activities. Applications to hold activities should 
be submitted to the SOAD not later than one (1) week before the scheduled activity. Exceptions to 
accepted procedure are referred to the Dean of Students.
